           <p>I have been taking photos ever since I won an instamatic camera at age six. As a child I remember experimenting with 3D pictures by taking two different shots of the same scene. Of course everything was film and print back then. I blew my pocket money pretty quickly! 

            I had the wonderful privilege of growing up in the wild, open and unspoilt surroundings of the Scottish Highlands, so inevitably my love affair with Scotland's staggering landscapes began there along with an understanding of composition and light forms. Over the years I've developed a style that pushes the boundary between photography and art. 
            
            I specialise in landscape and all forms of portrait photography - you can find more about Nik Sargent Photography services here. </p>
