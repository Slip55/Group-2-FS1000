To use images
Place images in a folder named for the page where they will be displayed
Name all images image##, where ## is an ascending number in the folder
All images need to be the same type (.jpg, .png, jpeg, etc), we can change this per folder but it would be best jsut to have one for all
    ex. image1, image2, etc
In html file - set a <div> id to 'photos'
             - set a <h3 hidden> id to the folder name where this pages image sit
